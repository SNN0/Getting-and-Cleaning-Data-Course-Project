# README
This repository contains the scripts and files related to the project on collecting, working with, and cleaning the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

## Files
- 'run_analysis.R': This R script performs the required analysis step to clean and trasnform the dataset.
- 'CodeBook.md': This file describes the variables, the data, and the data transformation steps performed.
- 'tidyData.txt': This file contains the final tidy dataset with the average values of the selected measurement variables.
- Other files: The repository also includes the original dataset files downloaded from the source.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the reporsitory to your local machine.
2. Run the 'run_analysis.R' script in R or RStudio. Make sure the necessary packages are installed.
3. The script will download the dataset, perform the required transformations, and generate the tidy dataset.
4. The tidy dataset will be saved as 'tidyData.txt'.

For detailed information on the analysis steps and the data, refer to the 'CodeBook.md' file.

Note: The code and files in this repository were created as part of the project submission and demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
